To read or write a binary file, you need to write the path (location) of the file in the node's `File(s) Selector` parameter (for the Read operation) or in the node's `File Path and Name` parameter (for the Write operation).

/// warning | Naming the right path
The file path looks slightly different depending on how you are running n8n:

- npm: `~/my_file.json`
- n8n cloud / Docker: `/tmp/my_file.json`
