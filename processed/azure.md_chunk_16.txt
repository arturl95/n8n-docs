## Set up DNS

n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the n8n service. Find the IP address of the n8n service from the **Services & ingresses** menu item of the cluster you want to use under the **External IP** column. You need to add the n8n port, "5678" to the URL.
