> Create a markdown text for Slack that counts how many ideas, features and bugs have been submitted. The type of submission is saved in the property_type field. A feature has the property "Feature", a bug has the property "Bug" and an idea has the property "Bug". Also, list the five top submissions by vote in that message. Use "<url|text>" as markdown for links.

Take a look at the code the AI generates.

This is the JavaScript you need:

```js
const submissions = $input.all();
