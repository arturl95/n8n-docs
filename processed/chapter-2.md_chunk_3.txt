Let's get the title of the latest n8n blog post:

1. Use the **HTTP Request node** to make a GET request to the URL `https://blog.n8n.io/` (this endpoint requires no authentication).
2. Connect an **HTML node** and configure it to extract the title of the first blog post on the page.
	- Hint: If you're not familiar with CSS selectors or reading HTML, the CSS selector `.item-title  a` should help!
