- Reorganizes the JSON into a multi-level hierarchy following the form's groups. By default, question grouping hierarchy is materialized by a `/` character in the field names, for example `Group1/Question1`. With reformatting enabled, n8n reorganizes these into `Group1.Question1`, as nested JSON objects.
- Renames fields to trim `_` (not supported by many downstream systems).
- Parses all geospatial fields (Point, Line, and Area question types) into their standard GeoJSON equivalent.
