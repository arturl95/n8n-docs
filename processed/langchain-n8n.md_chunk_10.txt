#### Miscellaneous

Utility nodes.

[LangChain Code](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.code/): import LangChain. This means if there is functionality you need that n8n hasn't created a node for, you can still use it.

### Sub-nodes

Each root node can have one or more sub-nodes attached to it.
