You're most likely familiar with HTML and XML.

/// note | HTML vs. XML
HTML is a markup language used to describe the structure and semantics of a web page. XML looks similar to HTML, but the tag names are different, as they describe the kind of data they hold.
///
If you need to process HTML or XML data in your n8n workflows, use the [**HTML node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/) or the [**XML node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.xml/).
