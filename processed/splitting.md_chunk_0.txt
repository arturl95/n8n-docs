# Splitting workflows with conditional nodes

Splitting uses the [IF](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) or [Switch](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/) nodes. It turns a single-branch workflow into a multi-branch workflow. This is a key piece of representing complex logic in n8n.
