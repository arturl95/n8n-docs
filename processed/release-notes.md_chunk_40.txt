### New canvas in beta
The new canvas is now the default setting for all users. It should bring significant performance improvements and adds a handy minimap. As it is still a beta version you can still revert to the previous version with the three dot menu.  

We're looking forward to your feedback. Should you encounter a bug, you will find a handy button to create an issue at the bottom of the new canvas as well.
