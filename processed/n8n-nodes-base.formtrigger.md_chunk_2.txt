## Build and test workflows

While building or testing a workflow, use the **Test URL**. Using a test URL ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging. 

There are two ways to test:

- Select **Test Step**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the node, but not the rest of the workflow.
- Select **Test Workflow**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the workflow.
