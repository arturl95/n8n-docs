- A **Subdomain**: Your subdomain is the part of your Wufoo URL that comes after `https://` and before `wufoo.com`. So if the full domain is `https://n8n.wufoo.com`, the subdomain is `n8n`. Admins can view the subdomain in the [**Account Manager**](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/wufoo/account-manager){:target=_blank .external-link}. Refer to [Your Subdomain](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/wufoo/account/your-subdomain/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
