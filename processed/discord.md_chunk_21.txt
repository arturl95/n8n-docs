A **bot** is an interactive step up from a webhook. You add bots to the Discord server (referred to as a `guild` in the Discord API documentation) or to user accounts. Bots added to the server can interact with users on all the server's channels. They can manage channels, send and retrieve messages, retrieve the list of all users, and change their roles. If you need to build an interactive, complex, or multi-step workflow, use a bot.
