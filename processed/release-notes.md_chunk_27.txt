### Improved commit modal 

We added filters and text search to the commit modal when working with [Environments](/source-control-environments/). This will make committing easier as we provide more information and better visibility. Environments are available on the Enterprise plan. 

For full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases){:target=_blank .external-link} on GitHub.
