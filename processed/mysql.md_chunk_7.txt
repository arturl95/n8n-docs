6. Enter the **Connect Timeout** you'd like the node to use. The Connect Timeout is the number of milliseconds during the initial database connection the node should wait before timing out. n8n defaults to `1000` which is the default used by MySQL of 10 seconds. If you want to match your database's `connect_timeout`, run this query to get it, then multiply by 100 before entering it in n8n:

    ```
    SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name = 'connect_timeout';
    ```
