# LangChain Code node

Use the LangChain Code node to import LangChain. This means if there is functionality you need that n8n hasn't created a node for, you can still use it. By configuring the LangChain Code node connectors you can use it as a normal node, root node or sub-node.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters, guidance on configuring the node, and links to more resources.

/// note | Not available on Cloud
