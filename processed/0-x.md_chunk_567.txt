### Enhanced nodes

* [Telegram:](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/) Added binary data support to the Send Animation, Send Audio, Send Document, Send Photo, Send Video, and Send Sticker operations.

### Core Functionality
- Fixed startup behavior when running n8n in scaled mode (i.e. `skipWebhoooksDeregistrationOnShutdown` is enabled).
- Fixed behavior around handling empty response bodies.
- Fixed an issue with handling of refresh tokens.
