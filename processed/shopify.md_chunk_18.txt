### Forbidden credentials error

<!-- vale off -->
If you get a **Couldn't connect with these settings / Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials** warning when you test the credentials, this may be due to your app's [access scope](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes){:target=_blank .external-link} dependencies. For example, the `read_orders` scope also requires `read_products` scope. Review the scopes you have assigned and the action you're trying to complete.
