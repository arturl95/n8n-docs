# OpenAI Functions Agent node

Use the OpenAI Functions Agent node to use an [OpenAI functions model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling){:target=_blank .external-link}. These are models that detect when a function should be called and respond with the inputs that should be passed to the function.

Refer to [AI Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index/) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.
