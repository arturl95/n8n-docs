Use n8n to scrape a website, load the data into Pinecone, then query it using a chat workflow. This workflow uses the [HTTP node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to get website data, extracts the relevant content using the [HTML node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/), then uses the [Pinecone Vector Store node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstorepinecone/) to send it to Pinecone.
