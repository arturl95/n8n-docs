### Don't change incoming data

Never change the incoming data a node receives (data accessible with `this.getInputData()`) as all nodes share it. If you need to add, change, or delete data, clone the incoming data and return the new data. If you don't do this, sibling nodes that execute after the current one will operate on the altered data and process incorrect data.
