# Set up SSL

There are two methods to support TLS/SSL in n8n.

## Use a reverse proxy (recommended)

Use a reverse proxy like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/){:target=_blank .external-link} or a Network Load Balancer (NLB) in front of the n8n instance. This should also take care of certificate renewals.
