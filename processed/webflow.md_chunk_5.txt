Use these settings for your application:

- Copy the **OAuth callback URL** from n8n and add it as a **Redirect URI** in your application.
- Once you've created your application, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and enter them in your n8n credential.
- If you are using the Webflow Data API V1 (deprecated), enable the **Legacy** toggle. Otherwise, leave this inactive.
