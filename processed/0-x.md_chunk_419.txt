### Breaking change to GraphQL node

The GraphQL node now errors when the response includes an error. If you use this node, you can choose to:

* Do nothing: a GraphQL response containing an error will now cause the workflow to fail.
* Update your GraphQL node settings: set **Continue on Fail** to true to allow the workflow to continue even when the GraphQL response contains an error.

### New features

You can now download binary data from individual nodes in your workflow.
