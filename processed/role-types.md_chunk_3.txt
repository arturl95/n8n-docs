## Project Viewer

A Project Viewer is effectively a `read-only` role with access to all workflows, credentials, and executions within a project.

Viewers aren't able to manually execute any workflows that exist in a project. 

/// note | Role types and account types
Role types and [account types](/user-management/account-types/) are different things. Every account has one type. The account can have different role types for different [projects](/user-management/rbac/projects/).
