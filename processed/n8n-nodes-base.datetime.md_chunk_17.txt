ISO duration format displays a format as `P<n>Y<n>M<n>DT<n>H<n>M<n>S`. `<n>` is the number for the unit after it.

* P = period (duration). It begins all ISO duration strings.
* Y = years
* M = months
* W = weeks
* D = days
* T = delineator between dates and times, used to avoid confusion between months and minutes
* H = hours
* M = minutes
* S = seconds

Milliseconds don't get their own unit, but instead are decimal seconds. For example, 2.1 milliseconds is `0.0021S`.
