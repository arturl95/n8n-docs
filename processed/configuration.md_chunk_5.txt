```sh
    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data @oauth-credentials.json http://localhost:5678/send-credentials
    ```

/// note
There are cases when credentials are based on others. For example, the `googleSheetsOAuth2Api` extends the `googleOAuth2Api`.
In this case, you can set parameters on the parent credentials (`googleOAuth2Api`) for all child-credentials (`googleSheetsOAuth2Api`) to use.
