## Step seven: Test the workflow

1. You can now test the entire workflow. Select **Test Workflow**. n8n runs the workflow, showing each stage in progress.
2. Go back to your Postbin bin. Refresh the page to see the output.
3. If you want to use this workflow (in other words, if you want it to run once a week automatically), you need to activate it by selecting the **Active** toggle.
