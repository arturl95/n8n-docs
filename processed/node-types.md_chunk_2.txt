## Credentials

External services need a way to identify and authenticate users. This data can range from an API key over an email/password combination to a long multi-line private key. You can save these in n8n as credentials.

Nodes in n8n can then request that credential information. As another layer of security, only node types with specific access rights can access the credentials.
