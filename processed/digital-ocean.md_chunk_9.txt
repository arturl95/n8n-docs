## Clone configuration repository

Docker Compose, n8n, and Caddy require a series of folders and configuration files.

The following steps will tell you which file to change and what changes to make.

Clone the repository with the following command:

git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy.git
