volumes:
  traefik_data:

  n8n_data:
    external: true
```

If you are planning on reading/writing local files with n8n (for example, by using the [Read/Write Files from Disk node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/), you will need to configure a data directory for those files here. If you are running n8n as a root user, add this under `volumes` for the n8n service:

```yaml
- /local-files:/files
```
