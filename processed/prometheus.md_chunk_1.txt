```bash
export N8N_METRICS=true
```

Refer to the respective [Environment Variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/endpoints/) (`N8N_METRICS_INCLUDE_*`) for configuring which metrics and labels should get exposed.

Both `main` and `worker` instances are able to expose metrics.

## Queue metrics

To enable queue metrics, set the `N8N_METRICS_INCLUDE_QUEUE_METRICS` env var to `true`. You can adjust the refresh rate with `N8N_METRICS_QUEUE_METRICS_INTERVAL`.
