## Avoiding out of memory situations

When encountering an out of memory situation, there are two options: either increase the amount of memory available to n8n or reduce the memory consumption.

### Increase available memory

When self-hosting n8n, increasing the amount of memory available to n8n means provisioning your n8n instance with more memory. This may incur additional costs with your hosting provider.

On n8n cloud you need to upgrade to a larger plan.
