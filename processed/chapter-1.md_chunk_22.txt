These JavaScript examples assume your entire input is what you want to transform. As in the exercise above, you can also execute either operation on a specific field by identifying that in the items list, for example, if our workEmail example had multiple emails in a single field, we could run some code like this:
```javascript
let items = $input.all();
return items[0].json.workEmail.map(item => {
	return {
		json: item
	}
});
```
