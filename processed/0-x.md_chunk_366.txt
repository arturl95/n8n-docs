#### The n8n public API

This release introduces the n8n public REST API. Using n8n's public API, you can programmatically perform many of the same tasks as you can in the GUI. The API includes a built-in Swagger UI playground. Refer to the [API documentation](/api/){:target=_blank} for more information.
