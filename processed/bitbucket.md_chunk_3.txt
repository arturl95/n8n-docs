## App password permissions

Bitbucket API credentials will only work if the user account you generated the app password for has the appropriate privilege scopes for the selected app password permissions. The n8n credentials dialog will throw an error if the user account lacks the appropriate permissions for the selected scope, like `Your credentials lack one or more required privilege scopes`.
