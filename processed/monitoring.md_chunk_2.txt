```
<your-instance-url>/healthz
```

The `/healthz/readiness` endpoint is similar to the `/healthz` endpoint, but it returns a HTTP status code of 200 if the DB is connected and migrated and therefore the instance is ready to accept traffic.

Access the endpoint:

```
<your-instance-url>/healthz/readiness
```


## metrics

The `/metrics` endpoint provides more detailed information about the current status of the instance.

Access the endpoint:

```
<your-instance-url>/metrics
```
