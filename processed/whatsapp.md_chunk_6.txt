## Using API key

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An API **Access Token**: Generated when you create a Meta app with WhatsApp as the product.
- A **Business Account ID**: Generated for all WhatsApp Business accounts. You can view yours in **Business Manager** > **Business Settings** > **Accounts** > **WhatsApp Business Accounts** and view your account details, or copy it from the Meta app you create.
