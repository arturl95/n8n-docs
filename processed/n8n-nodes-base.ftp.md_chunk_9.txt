/// note | Uploading files
To attach a file for upload, you'll need to use an extra node such as the [Read/Write Files from Disk](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) node or the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node to pass the file as a data property.
