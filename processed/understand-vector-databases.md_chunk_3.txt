## A simplified example

A vector database could store the sentence "n8n is a source-available automation tool that you can self-host", but instead of storing it as text, the vector database stores an array of dimensions (numbers between 0 and 1) that represent its features. This doesn't mean turning each letter in the sentence into a number. Instead, the vectors in the vector database describe the sentence.
