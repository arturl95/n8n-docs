## Running CLI commands

You can use CLI commands with self-hosted n8n. Depending on how you choose to install n8n, there are differences in how to run the commands:

* npm: the `n8n` command is directly available. The documentation uses this in the examples below.
* Docker: the `n8n` command is available within your Docker container:
    ```sh
    docker exec -u node -it <n8n-container-name> <n8n-cli-command>
    ```

## Start a workflow

You can start workflows directly using the CLI.
