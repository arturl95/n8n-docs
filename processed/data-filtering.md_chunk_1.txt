To search:

1. In a node, select **Search** <span class="inline-image">![Search icon](/_images/common-icons/search.png){.off-glb}</span> in the **INPUT** or **OUTPUT** panel.
1. Enter your search term.

n8n filters as you type your search, displaying the objects or rows containing the term.

Filtering is purely visual: n8n doesn't change or delete data. The filter resets when you close and reopen the node.
