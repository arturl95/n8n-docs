Internal integrations use a simpler authentication process (the integration secret) and don't require any security review before publishing.

**Public** integrations are:

* Usable across multiple, unrelated Notion workspaces.
* Accessible by any Notion user, regardless of their workspace.
* Ideal for catering to broad use cases.

Public integrations use the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication. They require a Notion security review before publishing.
