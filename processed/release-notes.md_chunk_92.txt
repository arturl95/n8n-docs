Drag and drop insertion on cursor position from schema view is now also enabled for code, SQL and Html fields in nodes. 

Customers with an enterprise license can now rate, tag and highlight execution data in the executions view. To use highlighting, add an [Execution Data Node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executiondata/) (or Code node) to the workflow to set [custom executions data](/workflows/executions/custom-executions-data/).
