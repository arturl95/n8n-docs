## Node options

- **Ignore Case**: Whether to ignore letter case (turned on) or be case sensitive (turned off).
- **Less Strict Type Validation**: Whether you want n8n to attempt to convert value types based on the operator you choose (turned on) or not (turned off). Turn this on when facing a "wrong type:" error in your node.
