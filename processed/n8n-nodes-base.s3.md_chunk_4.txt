/// note | Attach file for upload
    To attach a file for upload, use another node to pass the file as a data property. Nodes like the [Read/Write Files from Disk](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) node or the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) work well.
