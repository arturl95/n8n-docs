The Tools Agent implements [Langchain's tool calling](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts/tool_calling/){:target=_blank .external-link} interface. This interface describes available tools and their schemas. The agent also has improved output parsing capabilities, as it passes the parser to the model as a formatting tool.
