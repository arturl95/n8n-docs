## Using API key

/// warning | Method deprecated
Shopify no longer generates API keys with passwords. Use the [Access token](#using-access-token) method instead.
///

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **API Key**
- A **Password**
- Your **Shop Subdomain**: Your subdomain is within the URL: `https://<subdomain>.myshopify.com`. For example, if the full URL is `https://n8n.myshopify.com`, the Shop Subdomain is `n8n`.
- _Optional:_ A **Shared Secret**
