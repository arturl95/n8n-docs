=== "Single-branch"

    [Create a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository){:target=_blank .external-link}. 

      * Make sure the repository is private, unless you want your workflows, tags, and variable and credential stubs exposed to the internet.  
      * Create the new repository with a README. This creates the `main` branch, which you'll connect to.
