/// note | Error workflows
- If a workflow uses the Error Trigger node, you don't have to activate the workflow.
- If a workflow contains the Error Trigger node, by default, the workflow uses itself as the error workflow.
- You can't test error workflows when running workflows manually. The Error trigger only runs when an automatic workflow errors.
- You can set the same Error Workflow for multiple workflows.
