Now you can start your n8n instance and it will connect to your Redis instance.

### Start workers

You will need to start worker processes to allow n8n to execute workflows. If you want to host workers on a separate machine, install n8n on the machine and make sure that it's connected to your Redis instance and the n8n database.

Start worker processes by running the following command from the root directory:

```
./packages/cli/bin/n8n worker
```
