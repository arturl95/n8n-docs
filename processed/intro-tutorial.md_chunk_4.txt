## Step three: Add a trigger node

A trigger node starts a workflow. For this tutorial, use the [Chat Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/). This provides a chat interface that you can use to test the workflow.

1. Select **Add first step**.
1. Search for **Chat Trigger**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
1. Select **Chat Trigger** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.
1. Close the node details view to return to the canvas.
