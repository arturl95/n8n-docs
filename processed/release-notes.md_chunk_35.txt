The Task runner comes in two modes:

- Internal mode (default): Perfect for getting started, automatically managing task runners as child processes  
- External mode: For advanced hosting scenarios requiring maximum isolation and security

Currently, this feature is opt-in and can be enabled using [environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/task-runners/). Once stable, it will become the default execution method for Code nodes.
