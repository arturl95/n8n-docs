## Mocking with real data using data pinning

Using [data pinning](/data/data-pinning/), you load real data into your workflow, then pin it in the output panel of a node. Using this approach you have realistic data, with only one call to your data source. You can [edit pinned data](/data/data-editing/).

Use this approach when you need to configure your workflow to handle the exact data structure and parameters provided by your data source.
