# SQL AI Agent node

The SQL Agent uses a SQL database as a data source. It can understand natural language questions, convert them into SQL queries, execute the queries, and present the results in a user-friendly format. This agent is valuable for building natural language interfaces to databases.

Refer to [AI Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index/) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.
