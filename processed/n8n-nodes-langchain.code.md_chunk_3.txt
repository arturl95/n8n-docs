* **Execute**: use the LangChain Code node like n8n's own Code node. This takes input data from the workflow, processes it, and returns it as the node output. This mode requires a main input and output. You must create these connections in **Inputs** and **Outputs**.
* **Supply Data**: use the LangChain Code node as a sub-node, sending data to a root node. This uses an output other than main.
