# n8n Form Trigger node

Use the n8n Form trigger to start a workflow when a user submits a form, taking the input data from the form. The node generates the form web page for you to use.

You can add more pages to continue the form with the [n8n Form](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/) node.
