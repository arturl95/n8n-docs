Data mapping maps the key path, and loads the key's value into the field. For example, given the following data:

```js
[
	{
		"fruit": "apples",
		"color": "green"
	}
]
```

You can map `fruit` by dragging and dropping **fruit** from the **INPUT** into the field where you want to use its value. This creates an expression, `{{ $json.fruit }}`. When the node iterates over input items, the value of the field becomes the value of `fruit` for each item.
