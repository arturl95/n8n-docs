/// note | Workflow execution status
You can filter the displayed **Executions** by workflow and by status (**Any Status**, **Failed**, **Cancelled**, **Running**, **Success**, or **Waiting**).
The information displayed here depends on which executions are configured to be saved in the [**Workflow Settings**](/workflows/settings/).
