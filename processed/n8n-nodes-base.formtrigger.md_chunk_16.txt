### Respond When

Choose when n8n sends a response to the form submission. You can respond when:

- **Form Is Submitted**: Send a response to the user as soon as they submit the form.
- **Workflow Finishes**: Use this if you want the workflow to complete its execution before you send a response to the user. If the workflow errors, it sends a response to the user telling them there was a problem submitting the form.
