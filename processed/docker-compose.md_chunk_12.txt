```yaml
- /local-files:/files
```

If you are running n8n as a non-root user, add this under `volumes` for the n8n service:

```yaml
- /home/<YOUR USERNAME>/n8n-local-files:/files
```

You will now be able to write files to the `/files` directory in n8n and they will appear on your server in either `/local-files` or `/home/<YOUR USERNAME>/n8n-local-files`, respectively.

### 6. Create `.env` file

Create an `.env` file and change it accordingly.
