### Docker Compose

```yaml
name: n8n
services:
    n8n:
        volumes:
            - ./pki:/opt/custom-certificates
        container_name: n8n
        ports:
            - 5678:5678
        image: docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

You should also give the right permissions to the imported certs. You can do this once the container is running (assuming n8n as the container name):

```bash
docker exec --user 0 n8n chown -R 1000:1000 /opt/custom-certificates
```
