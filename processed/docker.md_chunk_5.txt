If no directory is found, n8n creates automatically one on
startup. In this case, existing credentials saved with a different encryption key can not be used anymore.

/// note | Keep in mind
Persisting the `/home/node/.n8n` directory even when using alternate databases is the recommended best practice, but not explicitly required. The encryption key can be provided using the `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` [environment variable](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/).
