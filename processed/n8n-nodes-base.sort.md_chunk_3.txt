#### Simple options

When you select **Simple** as the **Type**, you have the option to **Disable Dot Notation**. By default, n8n enables dot notation to reference child fields in the format `parent.child`. Use this option to disable dot notation (turned on) or to continue using dot (turned off).

### Random

Creates a random order in the list.

### Code

Input custom JavaScript code to perform the sort operation. This is a good option if a simple sort won't meet your needs.
