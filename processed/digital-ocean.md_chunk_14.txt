## Configure n8n

n8n needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the Docker container. The example `.env` file contains placeholders you need to replace with values of your own.

Open the file with the following command:

```shell
nano .env
```

The file contains inline comments to help you know what to change.

Refer to [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.
