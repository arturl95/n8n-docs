### Paginate results

APIs paginate their results when they need to send more data than they can handle in a single response. For more information on pagination in the HTTP Request node, refer to [HTTP Request node | Pagination](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/#pagination).
