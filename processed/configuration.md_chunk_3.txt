#### Using REST APIs

The recommended way is to load the data using a custom REST endpoint. Set the `CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_ENDPOINT` to a path under which this endpoint should be made available.

/// note
The endpoints can be called just one at a time for security reasons.
///

For example:

1. Activate the endpoint by setting the environment variable in the environment n8n runs under:

    ```sh
    export CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_ENDPOINT=send-credentials
    ```
