### Date Exercise

Build a workflow that adds five days to an input date from the Customer Datastore node that you used before. Then, if the calculated date occurred after 1959, the workflow waits 1 minute before [setting](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) the calculated date as a value. The workflow should be triggered every 30 minutes.
