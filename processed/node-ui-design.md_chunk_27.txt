#### Dates and timestamps

n8n uses [ISO timestamp strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601){:target=_blank class=.external-link} for dates and times. Make sure that any date or timestamp field you add supports all ISO 8601 formats.

#### JSON

You should support two ways of specifying the content of a text input that expects JSON:

* Typing JSON directly into the text input: you need to parse the resulting string into a JSON object.
* Using an expression that returns JSON.
