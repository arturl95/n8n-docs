## Create a server

1. [Log in](https://console.hetzner.cloud/){:target=_blank .external-link} to the Hetzner Cloud Console.
2. Select the project to host the server, or create a new project by selecting **+ NEW PROJECT**.
3. Select **+ CREATE SERVER** on the project tile you want to add it to.

You can change most of the settings to suit your needs, but as this guide uses Docker to run the application, under the **Image** section, select "Docker CE" from the **APPS** tab.
