Your output in table view should look like this:
<!-- vale off -->
| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stefan | de |  |
| Jim | en |  |
| Hans | de |  |
|   | en | Hello |
|   | de | Hallo |
<!-- vale on -->

#### Combine by Matching Fields

You can merge these two data inputs so that each person gets the correct greeting for their language.
