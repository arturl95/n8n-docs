There are two types of static data, global and node. Global static data is the
same in the whole workflow. Every node in the workflow can access it. The node static data is unique to the node. Only the node that set it can retrieve it again.

Example with global data:

=== "JavaScript"
	```javascript
	// Get the global workflow static data
	const workflowStaticData = $getWorkflowStaticData('global');

	// Access its data
	const lastExecution = workflowStaticData.lastExecution;
