## Task runner modes

You can use task runners in two different modes: internal and external.

### Internal mode

In internal mode, the n8n instance launches the task runner as a child process. The n8n process monitors and manages the life cycle of the task runner. The task runner process shares the same `uid` and `gid` as n8n.

### External mode
