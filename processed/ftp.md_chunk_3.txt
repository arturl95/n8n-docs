## Using FTP account

Use this method if your FTP server doesn't support SSH tunneling or encrypted connections.

To configure this credential, you'll need to:

1. Enter the name or IP address of your FTP server's **Host**.
2. Enter the **Port** number the connection should use.
3. Enter the **Username** the credential should connect as.
4. Enter the user's **Password**.

Review your FTP server provider's documentation for instructions on getting the information you need.
