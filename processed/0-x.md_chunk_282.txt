* Added a `resourceLocator` parameter type for nodes, and started upgrading n8n's built-in nodes to use it. This new option helps users who need to specify the ID of a record or item in an external service. For example, when using the Trello node, you can now search for a specific card by ID, URL, or do a free text search for card titles. Node builders can learn more about working with this new UI element in n8n's [UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/)
