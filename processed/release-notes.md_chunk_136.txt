#### New node: Information Extractor

This release adds the [Information Extractor node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.information-extractor/). The node is specifically tailored for information extraction tasks. It uses Structured Output Parser under the hood, but provides a simpler way to extract information from text in a structured JSON form.
