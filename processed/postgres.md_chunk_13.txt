Only use the **SSH Tunnel** setting if:

- You're using the credential with the [Postgres](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgres/) node (Agent node doesn't support SSH tunnels).
- You have an SSH server running on the same machine as the Postgres server.
- You have a user account that can log in using `ssh`.
