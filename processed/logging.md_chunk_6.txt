n8n uses standard log levels to report:

- `silent`: outputs nothing at all
- `error`: outputs only errors and nothing else
- `warn`: outputs errors and warning messages
- `info`: contains useful information about progress
- `debug`: the most verbose output. n8n outputs a lot of information to help you debug issues.
