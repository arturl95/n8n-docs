n8n passes dates between nodes as strings, so you need to parse them. Luxon helps you do this. Refer to [Date and time with Luxon](/code/cookbook/luxon/) for more information.

n8n provides built-in convenience functions to support data transformation in expressions for dates. Refer to [Data transformation functions | Dates](/code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/dates/) for more information.
