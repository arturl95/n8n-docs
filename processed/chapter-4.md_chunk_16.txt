/// note | When to throw errors
Throwing exceptions with the **Stop and Error node** is useful for verifying the data (or assumptions about the data) from a node and returning custom error messages.

If you are working with data from a third-party service, you may come across problems such as:

- Wrongly formatted JSON output
- Data with the wrong type (for example, numeric data that has a non-numeric value)
- Missing values
- Errors from remote servers
