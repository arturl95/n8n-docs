## Identify rate limit issues

When an n8n node hits a rate limit, it errors. n8n displays the error message in the node output panel. This includes the error message from the service.

If n8n received error 429 (too many requests) from the service, the error message is **The service is receiving too many requests from you**.

To check the rate limits for the service you're using, refer to the API documentation for the service.
