```sh
export N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES=filesystem,s3
export N8N_DEFAULT_BINARY_DATA_MODE=s3
```

Restart the server to load the new configuration.

### Usage

After you enable S3, n8n writes and reads any new binary data to and from the S3 bucket. n8n writes binary data to your S3 bucket in this format:

```
workflows/{workflowId}/executions/{executionId}/binary_data/{binaryFileId}
```
