- When using `dropdown`, set the choices with `fieldOptions` (reference the example below). By default, the dropdown is single-choice. To make it multiple-choice, set `multiselect` to `true`.
	- When using `file`, set `multipleFiles` to `true` to allow users to select more than one file. To define the file types to allow, set `acceptFileTypes` to a string containing a comma-separated list of file extensions (reference the example below).
