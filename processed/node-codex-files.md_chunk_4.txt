## Node categories

You can define one or more categories in your node configuration JSON. This helps n8n put the node in the correct category in the nodes panel.

Choose from these categories:

* Data & Storage
* Finance & Accounting
* Marketing & Content
* Productivity
* Miscellaneous
* Sales
* Development
* Analytics
* Communication
* Utility

You must match the syntax. For example, `Data & Storage` not `data and storage`.
