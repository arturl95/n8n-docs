1. Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose the local server running on port `5678` to the internet. In your terminal, run the following command:
```sh
ngrok http 5678
```
2. Run the following command in a new terminal. Replace `<YOUR-NGROK-URL>` with the URL that you get from the previous step.
```sh
export WEBHOOK_URL=<YOUR-NGROK-URL>
```
3. Use the generated URL as your **OAuth 2 redirect URL** in Twist.
