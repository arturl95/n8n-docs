To turn LDAP off:

1. Log in to n8n as the instance owner.
2. Select **Settings** <span class="inline-image">![Settings icon](/_images/common-icons/settings.png){.off-glb}</span> > **LDAP**.
3. Toggle off **Enable LDAP Login**.

If you turn LDAP off, n8n converts existing LDAP users to email users on their next login. The users must reset their password.
