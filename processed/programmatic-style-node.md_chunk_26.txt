Note the following lines of this code:

```typescript
const items = this.getInputData();
... 
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
	...
	const email = this.getNodeParameter('email', i) as string;
	...
}
```

Users can provide data in two ways:

* Entered directly in the node fields
* By mapping data from earlier nodes in the workflow
