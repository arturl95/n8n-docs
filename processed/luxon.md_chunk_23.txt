### Get the time between two dates

To get the time between two dates, use Luxon's diffs feature. This subtracts one date from another and returns a duration.

For example, get the number of months between two dates:

=== "Expressions (JavaScript)"

	```js
	{{DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23').diff(DateTime.fromISO('2019-05-23'), 'months').toObject()}}
	```

	This returns `[Object: {"months":1}]`.
