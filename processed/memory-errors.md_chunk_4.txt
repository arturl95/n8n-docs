- Amount of [JSON data](/data/data-structure/).
- Size of binary data.
- Number of nodes in a workflow.
- Some nodes are memory-heavy: the [Code](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node and the older Function node can increase memory consumption significantly.
- Manual or automatic workflow executions: manual executions increase memory consumption as n8n makes a copy of the data for the frontend.
- Additional workflows running at the same time.
