## Parameters

Once you've set the events to trigger on, use the remaining parameters to further define the node's behavior:

* **Watch Whole Workspace**: Whether the node should watch for the selected **Events** in all channels in the workspace (turned on) or not (turned off, default).

    ///warning | Caution
    This will use one execution for every event in any channel your bot or app is in. Use with caution!
