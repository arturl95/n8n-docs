### Implementation details

n8n uses the `LoggerProxy` class, located in the `workflow` package. Calling the `LoggerProxy.init()` by passing in an instance of `Logger`, initializes the class before the usage.

The initialization process happens only once. The [`start.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/commands/start.ts) file already does this process for you. If you are creating a new command from scratch, you need to initialize the `LoggerProxy` class.
