If the workspace is deactivated, there will be no **Settings** page and no possibility to change the email address or the owner info.

## Change instance username

It's not currently possible to change usernames.

If you want your instance to have a different name you will need to create a new account and transfer your work into it. [The import/export documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/export-import/) explains how you can transfer your work to a new n8n instance.
