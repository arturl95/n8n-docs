The manifests define the following:

- Send the environment variables defined to each application pod
- Define the container image to use
- Set resource consumption limits
- The `volumes` defined earlier and `volumeMounts` to define the path in the container to mount volumes.
- Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs.
