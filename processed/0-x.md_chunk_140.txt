This release contains new features, node enhancements, and bug fixes. The expressions editor now supports autocomplete for some [built in data transformation functions](/code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/). The new features also include two of interest to node builders: a way to allow users to drag and drop data keys, and the new HTML editor component.
