## Sticky Note positioning

You can:

* Drag a Sticky Note anywhere on the canvas.
* Drag Sticky Notes behind nodes. You can use this to visually group nodes.
* Resize Sticky Notes by hovering over the edge of the note and dragging to resize.
* Change the color: select **Options** <span class="inline-image">![Options icon](/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png){.off-glb}</span> to open the color selector.
