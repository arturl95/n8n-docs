## Supported authentication methods

- API access token: Dropbox recommends this method for testing with your user account and granting a limited number of users access.
- OAuth2: Dropbox recommends this method for production or for testing with more than 50 users.

/// note | App reuse
You can transition an app from the API access token to OAuth2 by creating a new credential in n8n for OAuth2 using the same app.
