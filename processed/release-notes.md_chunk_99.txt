#### Queue metrics for workers

You can now [expose and consume metrics from your workers](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/prometheus/). The worker instances have the same metrics available as the main instance(s) and can be configured with [environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/endpoints/).
