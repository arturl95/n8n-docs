Now let's see how to implement this.

In your workflow, add a Code node** connected to the `false` branch of the **If node. 

With the Code node window open, configure these parameters:

- **Mode**: Select **Run Once for All Items**
- **Language**: Select **JavaScript**
- Copy the Code below and paste it into the **Code** box:
```javascript
let items = $input.all();
let totalBooked = items.length;
let bookedSum = 0;
