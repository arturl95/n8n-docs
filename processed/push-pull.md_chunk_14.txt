* n8n overwrites the entire variables and tags files.
* If a credential already exists, n8n overwrites it with the changes, but doesn't apply these changes to existing credentials on pull.

/// note | Manage credentials with an external secrets vault
If you need different credentials on different n8n environments, use [External secrets](/external-secrets/).
