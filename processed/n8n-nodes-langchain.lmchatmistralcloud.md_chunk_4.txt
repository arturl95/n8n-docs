* **Top P**: Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options. 
* **Enable Safe Mode**: Enable safe mode by injecting a safety prompt at the beginning of the completion. This helps prevent the model from generating offensive content.
* **Random Seed**: Enter a seed to use for random sampling. If set, different calls will generate deterministic results.
