* Info boxes: yellow boxes that appear between fields. Refer to [UI elements | Notice](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/#notice) for more information.
  * Use info boxes for essential information. Don't over-use them. By making them rare, they stand out more and grab the user's attention.
* Parameter hints: lines of text displayed beneath a user input field. Use this when there's something the user needs to know, but an info box would be excessive.
