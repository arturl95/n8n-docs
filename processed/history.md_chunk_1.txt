Use workflow history to view and restore previous versions of your workflows. 

## Understand workflow history

n8n creates a new version when you:

 * Save your workflow.
 * Restore an old version. n8n saves the latest version before restoring.
 * Pull from a Git repository using [Source control](/source-control-environments/). Note that n8n saves versions to the instance database, not to Git.
