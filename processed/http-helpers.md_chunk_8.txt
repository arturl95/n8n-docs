- `returnFullResponse`: Instead of returning just the body, returns an object with more data in the following format: `{body: body, headers: object, statusCode: 200, statusMessage: 'OK'}`
- `encoding`: n8n can detect the content type, but you can specify `arrayBuffer` to receive a Buffer you can read from and interact with.
