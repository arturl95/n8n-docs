## print (Python)

For technical information on `print()`, refer to the [Real Python's guide](https://realpython.com/python-print/){:target=_blank .external-link}.

For example, set your Code node **Language** to **Python**, copy the following code into the node, then open your console and run the node:

```python
a = "apple"
print(a)
```

### Handling an output of `[object Object]`

If the console displays `[object Object]` when you print, check the data type, then convert it as needed.
