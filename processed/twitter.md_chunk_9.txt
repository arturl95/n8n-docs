- If you're using the deprecated OAuth method, user rate limits apply. You'll have one limit per time window for each set of users' access tokens.
- If you're [Using OAuth2](#using-oauth2), app rate limits apply. You'll have a limit per time window for requests made by your app.

X calculates user rate limits and app rate limits independently.
