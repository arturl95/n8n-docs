* **Disable Dot Notation**: The node displays this toggle when you select the **Individual Fields** Aggregate. It controls whether to disallow referencing child fields using `parent.child` in the field name (turned on), or allow it (turned off, default).
* **Merge Lists**: The node displays this toggle when you select the **Individual Fields** Aggregate. Turn it on if the field to aggregate is a list and you want to output a single flat list rather than a list of lists.
