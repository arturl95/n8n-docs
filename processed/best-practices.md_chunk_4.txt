## Self-hosted

If you run n8n behind a reverse proxy, set the following environment variables so that n8n generates emails with the correct URL:

* `N8N_HOST`
* `N8N_PORT`
* `N8N_PROTOCOL`
* `N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL`  

More information on these variables is available in [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/).
