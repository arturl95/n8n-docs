# Workflow development

The [Webhook node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) works a bit differently from other core nodes. n8n recommends following these processes for building, testing, and using your Webhook node in production.

n8n generates two **Webhook URLs** for each Webhook node: a **Test URL** and a **Production URL**.

## Build and test workflows

While building or testing a workflow, use the **Test** webhook URL.
