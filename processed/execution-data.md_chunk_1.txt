## Reduce saved data

/// note | Configuration at workflow level
You can also configure these settings on an individual workflow basis using the [workflow settings](/workflows/workflows/#workflow-settings).
///
You can select which executions data n8n saves. For example, you can save only executions that result in an `Error`.

```sh
# npm
# Save executions ending in errors
export EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_ERROR=all

# Save successful executions
export EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_SUCCESS=all
