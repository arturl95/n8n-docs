## Usage Notes

### Model Temperature Setting

It's strongly advised to set the temperature of the connected language model to 0 or a value close to 0. This helps ensure that the results are as deterministic as possible, providing more consistent and reliable sentiment analysis across multiple runs.

### Language Considerations

The node's performance may vary depending on the language of the input text.

For best results, ensure your chosen language model supports the input language.
