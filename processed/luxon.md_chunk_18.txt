=== "Code node (JavaScript)"

	For example, you want a variable containing the date seven days before the current date.

	In the code editor, enter:

	``` js
	let sevenDaysAgo = $today.minus({days: 7})
	```

	On the 23rd June 2019, this returns `[Object: "2019-06-16T00:00:00.000+00:00"]`.

	This example uses n8n's custom variable `$today` for convenience. It's the equivalent of `DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).minus({days: 7})`.
