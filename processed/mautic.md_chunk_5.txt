To set it up:

1. In Mautic, go to **Configuration > Settings**.
2. Select **API Credentials**.

    /// note | No API Credentials menu
    If you don't see the **API Credentials** option under **Configuration > Settings**, be sure to [Enable the API](#enable-the-api). If you've enabled the API and you still don't see the option, try [manually clearing the cache](https://forum.mautic.org/t/cant-find-api-credentials-menu/10689){:target=_blank .external-link}.
