## Test mode and live mode

All Stripe API requests happen within either [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode) or live mode. Each mode has its own API key. 

Use test mode to access simulated test data and live mode to access actual account data. Objects in one mode arenâ€™t accessible to the other.
