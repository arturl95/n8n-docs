## Step seven: Test the workflow

You can now try out the workflow: close any open nodes, then select **Chat** to start talking with the AI. Ask `Please give me a list of fruits`. The AI Agent node executes the workflow you specified in **Workflow ID**, passing in the value of `visibility` from the **Workflow Values** field. The workflow generates some sample data, filters it to remove any items that aren't set to `public`, and returns the resulting data.
