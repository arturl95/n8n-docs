### TLS

You can choose between these configurations:

- Not declaring (default): Connect with `SSL=off`
- Declaring only the CA and unauthorized flag: Connect with `SSL=on` and verify the server's signature
- Declaring `_{CERT,KEY}` and the above: Use the certificate and key for client TLS authentication
