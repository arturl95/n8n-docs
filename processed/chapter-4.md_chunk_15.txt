## Throwing exceptions in workflows

Another way of troubleshooting workflows is to include a [**Stop and Error node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stopanderror/) in your workflow. This node throws an error. You can specify the error type:

- **Error Message**: returns a custom message about the error
- **Error Object**: returns the type of error

You can only use the **Stop and Error node** as the last node in a workflow.
