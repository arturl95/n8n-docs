* Single input, single output: the output links to the input.
* Single input, multiple outputs: all outputs link to that input.
* Multiple inputs and outputs:
	* If you keep the input items, but change the order (or remove some but keep others), n8n can automatically add the correct linked item information.
	* If the number of inputs and outputs is equal, n8n links the items in order. This means that output-1 links to input-1, output-2 to input-2, and so on.
