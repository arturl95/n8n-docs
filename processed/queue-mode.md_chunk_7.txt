Set the encryption key for each worker node in a [configuration file](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/) or by setting the corresponding environment variable:

```bash
export N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<main_instance_encryption_key>
```

### Set executions mode

/// note | Database considerations
n8n recommends using Postgres 13+. Running n8n with execution mode set to `queue` with an SQLite database isn't recommended.
