/// warning | Property Input in dot notation
If you want to reference nested values in the **Merge node** parameters `Input 1 Field` and `Input 2 Field`, you need to enter the property key in dot-notation format (as text, not as an expression).
///

/// note
You can also find the **Merge node** under the alias Join. This might be more intuitive if you're familiar with SQL joins.
