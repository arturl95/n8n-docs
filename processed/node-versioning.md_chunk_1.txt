* If a user builds and saves a workflow using version 1, n8n continues to use version 1 in that workflow, even if you create and publish a version 2 of the node.
* When a user creates a new workflow and browses for nodes, n8n always loads the latest version of the node.

/// note | Versioning type restricted by node style
If you build a node using the declarative style, you can't use full versioning.
///
## Light versioning

This is available for all node types.
