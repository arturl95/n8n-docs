## Syntax differences

To understand the difference between the declarative and programmatic styles, compare the two code snippets below. This example creates a simplified version of the SendGrid integration, called "FriendGrid." The following code snippets aren't complete: they emphasize the differences in the node building styles.

In programmatic style:

```js
import {
	IExecuteFunctions,
	INodeExecutionData,
	INodeType,
	INodeTypeDescription,
	IRequestOptions,
} from 'n8n-workflow';
