* This workflow must be triggered by a [Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) node.
* The incoming webhook call must contain the user’s credentials and any other workflow parameters required.
* Each node where the user’s credentials are needed should use an [expression](/code/expressions/) so that the node’s credential field reads the credential provided in the webhook call.
