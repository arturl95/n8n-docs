/// note | Minor changes in 1.49.0
n8n version 1.49.0 introduced the option to add more than two inputs. Older versions only support up to two inputs. If you're running an older version and want to combine multiple inputs in these versions, use the [Code node](https://deploy-preview-2225--n8n-docs.netlify.app/code/code-node/).

The **Mode > SQL Query** feature was also added in n8n version 1.49.0 and isn't available in older versions.
