1. Log in as root.
2. Create a new user:
	```shell
	adduser <username>
	```
3. Follow the prompts in the CLI to finish creating the user.
4. Grant the new user administrative privileges:
	```shell
	usermod -aG sudo <username>
	```
	You can now run commands with superuser privileges by using `sudo` before the command.
