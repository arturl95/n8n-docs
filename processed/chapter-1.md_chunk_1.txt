## Data structure of n8n

In a basic sense, n8n nodes function as an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) tool. The nodes allow you to access (extract) data from multiple disparate sources, modify (transform) that data in a particular way, and pass (load) it along to where it needs to be.

The data that moves along from node to node in your workflow must be in a format (structure) that can be recognized and interpreted by each node. In n8n, this required structure is an array of objects.
