### Enhanced node: Remove Duplicates
The [Remove Duplicates node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/) got a major makeover with the addition of two new operations: 

- Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions: Compare items in the current input to items from previous executions and remove duplicates  
- Clear Deduplication History: Wipe the memory of items from previous executions.
