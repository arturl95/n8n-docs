To load data from a previous execution:

1. In your workflow, select the **Executions** tab to view the **Executions** list.
1. Select the execution you want to debug. n8n displays options depending on whether the workflow was successful or failed:
	* For failed executions: select **Debug in editor**.
	* For successful executions: select **Copy to editor**.
1. n8n copies the execution data into your current workflow, and [pins the data](/data/data-pinning/) in the first node in the workflow.
