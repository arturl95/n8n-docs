#### Invite link for users on self-hosted n8n

In earlier versions of self-hosted n8n, you needed SMTP set up on your n8n instance for user management to work. User management required SMTP to sent invitation emails.

0.210.1 introduces an invite link, which you can copy and send to users manually. n8n still recommends setting up SMTP, as this is needed for password resets.
