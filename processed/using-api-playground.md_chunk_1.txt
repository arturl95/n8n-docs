The n8n API comes with a built-in Swagger UI playground in self-hosted versions. This provides interactive documentation, where you can try out requests. The path to access the playground depends on your hosting.

n8n constructs the path from values set in your environment variables:

```shell
N8N_HOST:N8N_PORT/N8N_PATH/api/v<api-version-number>/docs
```

The API version number is `1`. There may be multiple versions available in the future.
