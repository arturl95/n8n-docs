- Concurrency control applies only to production executions: those started from a webhook or trigger node. It doesn't apply to any other kinds, such as manual executions, sub-workflow executions, error executions, or started from CLI.
- You can't retry queued executions. Cancelling or deleting a queued execution also removes it from the queue.
- On instance startup, n8n resumes queued executions up to the concurrency limit and re-enqueues the rest.
