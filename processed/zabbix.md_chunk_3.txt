## Using API key

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- an **API Token**: An API key for your Zabbix user.
- the **URL**: The URL of your Zabbix server. Don't include `/zabbix` as part of the URL.

Refer to [Zabbix's API documentation](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/api#authentication){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about authenticating to the service.
