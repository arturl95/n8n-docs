### 3. Create the workflow

Best practice is to have a “base” workflow that you then duplicate and customize for each new user with their credentials (and any other details).

You can duplicate and customize your template workflow using either the Editor UI or API call.

#### Using the Editor UI

1. From the menu select **Workflows** > **Open** to open the template workflow to be duplicated.
