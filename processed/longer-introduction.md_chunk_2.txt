## Step three: Add a trigger node

n8n provides two ways to start a workflow:

* Manually, by selecting **Test Workflow**, or from the CLI if you installed n8n with npm or Docker.
* Automatically, using a trigger node as the first node. The trigger node runs the workflow in response to an external event, or based on your settings.
