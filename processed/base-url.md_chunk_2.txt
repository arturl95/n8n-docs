You can configure the Base URL that the front end uses to connect to the back end's REST API. This is relevant when you want to host n8n's front end and back end separately. 

```bash
export VUE_APP_URL_BASE_API=https://n8n.example.com/
```
Refer to [Environment variables reference](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) for more information on this variable.
