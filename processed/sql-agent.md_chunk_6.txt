### Ignored Tables

If you'd like the node to ignore any tables from the database, enter a comma-separated list of tables you'd like it to ignore.

If left empty, the agent doesn't ignore any tables.

### Include Sample Rows

Enter the number of sample rows to include in the prompt to the agent. Default is `3`.

Sample rows help the agent understand the schema of the database, but they also increase the number of tokens used.
