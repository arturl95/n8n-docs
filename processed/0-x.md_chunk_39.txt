This release deprecates the following:

* The `EXECUTIONS_PROCESS` environment variable.
* Running n8n in own mode. Main mode is now the default. Use [Queue mode](/hosting/scaling/queue-mode/) if you need full execution isolation.
* The `WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL` flag. Replaced by `WEBHOOK_URL`.
* Support for MySQL and MariaDB as n8n backend databases. n8n will remove support completely in version 1.0. n8n recommends using PostgreSQL instead.
