- **Include Linked Files/Folders**: also watch for changes to linked files or folders.
- **Ignore**: files or paths to ignore. n8n tests the whole path, not just the filename. Supports the [Anymatch](https://github.com/micromatch/anymatch){:target=_blank .external-link} syntax.
- **Max Folder Depth**: how deep into the folder structure to watch for changes.

### Examples for Ignore

Ignore a single file:

```sh
**/<fileName>.<suffix>
# For example, **/myfile.txt
```
