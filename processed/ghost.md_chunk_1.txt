## Prerequisites

Create a [Ghost](https://ghost.org/){:target=_blank .external-link} account.

## Supported authentication methods

- Admin API key
- Content API key

The keys are generated following the same steps, but the authorization flows and key format are different, so n8n stores the credentials separately. The Content API uses an API key; the Admin API uses an API key to generate a token for authentication.
