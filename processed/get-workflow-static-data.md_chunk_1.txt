This gives access to the static workflow data.

/// note | Experimental feature
- Static data isn't available when testing workflows. The workflow must be active and called by a trigger or webhook to save static data.
- This feature may behave unreliably under high-frequency workflow executions.
///
You can save data directly in the workflow. This data should be small.
