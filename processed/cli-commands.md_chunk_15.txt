## License

### Clear

Clear your existing license from n8n's database and reset n8n to default features:

```sh
n8n license:clear
```

### Info

Display information about the existing license:

```sh
n8n license:info
```

## User management

You can reset user management using the n8n CLI. This returns user management to its pre-setup state. It removes all user accounts.

Use this if you forget your password, and don't have SMTP set up to do password resets by email.
