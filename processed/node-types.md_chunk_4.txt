## Community nodes

n8n supports custom nodes built by the community. Refer to [Community nodes](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) for guidance on installing and using these nodes.

For help building your own custom nodes, and publish them to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/){:target=_blank .external-link}, refer to [Creating nodes](/integrations/creating-nodes/overview/) for more information.
