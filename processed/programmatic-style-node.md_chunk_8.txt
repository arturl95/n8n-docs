In this example, the file is `FriendGrid.node.ts`. To keep this tutorial short, you'll place all the node functionality in this one file. When building more complex nodes, you should consider splitting out your functionality into modules. Refer to [Node file structure](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure/) for more information.

#### Step 3.1: Imports

Start by adding the import statements:

```typescript
import {
	IExecuteFunctions,
} from 'n8n-core';
