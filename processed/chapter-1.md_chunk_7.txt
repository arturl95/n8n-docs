## Creating data sets with the Code node

Now that you are familiar with the n8n data structure, you can use it to create your own data sets or simulate node outputs. To do this, use the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/){:target="_blank"} to write JavaScript code defining your array of objects with the following structure:

```javascript
return [
	{
		json: {
			apple: 'beets',
		}
	}
];
```
