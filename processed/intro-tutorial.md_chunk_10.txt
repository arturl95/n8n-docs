## Step six: Get data from another n8n workflow

One unique feature of AI in n8n is the ability to pull in data from other n8n workflows using the [Custom n8n Workflow Tool node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/). This means you can:

* Load your own custom data
* Create custom functionality in another workflow

Because n8n can connect to any service with a public API, this is a powerful tool.
