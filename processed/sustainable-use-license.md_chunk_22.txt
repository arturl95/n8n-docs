n8n asks every contributor to sign our [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md). In addition to the above, this gives n8n the ability to change its license without seeking additional permission. It also means you aren't liable for your contributions (e.g. in case they cause damage to someone else's business).
