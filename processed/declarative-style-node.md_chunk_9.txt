Start by adding the import statements:

```typescript
import { INodeType, INodeTypeDescription } from 'n8n-workflow';
```

#### Step 3.2: Create the main class

The node must export an interface that implements INodeType. This interface must include a `description` interface, which in turn contains the `properties` array.
