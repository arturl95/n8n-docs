- _Optional:_ Select whether to use **Sandbox Mode** for calls made using this credential. When turned on, all API calls use Sandbox mode: the API will still validate the payloads but won't deliver the actual messages. This can be useful to troubleshoot any payload error messages without actually sending messages. Refer to Mailjet's [Sandbox Mode documentation](https://dev.mailjet.com/email/guides/send-api-v31/#sandbox-mode){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
