- **Map Automatically**: n8n looks for incoming data that matches the columns in Google Sheets automatically. In this mode, make sure the incoming data fields are the same as the columns in Google Sheets. (Use an [Edit Fields](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node before this node to change them if required.)
    - **Nothing**: Don't map any data.
