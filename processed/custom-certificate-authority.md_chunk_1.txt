You can add your own certificate authority (CA) or self-signed certificate to n8n. This means you are able to trust a certain SSL certificate instead of trusting all invalid certificates, which is a potential security risk.

/// note | Available in version 1.42.0
This feature is only available in version 1.42.0+.

To use this feature you need to place your certificates in a folder and mount the folder to `/opt/custom-certificates` in the container.
