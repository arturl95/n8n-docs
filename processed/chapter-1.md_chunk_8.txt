For example, the array of objects representing the Ninja turtles would look like this in the Code node:

<figure><img src="/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/exercise_function_notnested.png" alt="" style="width:100%"><figcaption align = "center"><i>Array of objects in the Code node</i></figcaption></figure>

/// warning | JSON objects
Notice that this array of objects contains an extra key: `json`. n8n expects you to wrap each object in an array in another object, with the key `json`.
