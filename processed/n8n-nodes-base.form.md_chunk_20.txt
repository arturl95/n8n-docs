Form workflows that send data to multiple branches at the same time require more care. When multiple branches receive data during an execution (for example, from a [switch](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/) node), n8n executes each branch that receives data [sequentially](/flow-logic/execution-order/). Upon reaching the end of one branch, the execution will move to the next branch with data.
