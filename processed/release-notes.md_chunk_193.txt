#### New feature: Tools Agent

This release adds a new option to the Agent node: the [Tools Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent).

This agent has an enhanced ability to work with tools, and can ensure a standard output format. This is now the recommended default agent.
