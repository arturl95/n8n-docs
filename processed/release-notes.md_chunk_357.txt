#### Source control and environments

This release introduces source control and environments for enterprise users.

n8n uses Git-based source control to support environments. Linking your n8n instances to a Git repository lets you create multiple n8n environments, backed by Git branches.

Refer to [Source control and environments](/source-control-environments/) to learn more about the features and set up your environments.
