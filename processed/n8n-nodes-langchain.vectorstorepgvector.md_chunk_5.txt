### Use a retriever to fetch documents

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the PGVector Vector Store node to fetch documents from the PGVector Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.
