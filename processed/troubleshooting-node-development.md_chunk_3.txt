### Node icon doesn't fit

- If you use an SVG file, make sure the canvas size is square. You can find instructions to change the canvas size of an SVG file using GIMP [here](https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en/gimp-image-resize.html).
- If you use a PNG file, make sure that it's 60x60 pixels.

### Node doesn't show up in the Add Node menu

Check that you registered the node in the `package.json` file in your project.
