## Configure Postgres

For larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite.

To maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. The default storage class is suitable for this purpose and is defined in the `postgres-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest.
