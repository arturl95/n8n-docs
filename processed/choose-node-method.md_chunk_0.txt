# Choose your node building approach

n8n has two node-building styles, declarative and programmatic.

You should use the declarative style for most nodes. This style:

* Uses a JSON-based syntax, making it simpler to write, with less risk of introducing bugs.
* Is more future-proof.
* Supports integration with REST APIs.
