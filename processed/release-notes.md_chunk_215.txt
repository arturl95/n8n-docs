/// warning | Breaking change
Please note that this version contains a breaking change for self-hosted n8n. It removes the `--file` flag for the `execute` CLI command. If you have scripts relying on the `--file` flag, update them to first import the workflow and then execute it using the `--id` flag. Refer to [CLI commands](/hosting/cli-commands/) for more information on CLI options.
