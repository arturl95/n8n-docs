/// warning | [Breaking change](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md){:target=_blank .external-link}
The N8N_BLOCK_FILE_ACCESS_TO_N8N_FILES environment variable now also blocks access to n8n's static cache directory at ~/.cache/n8n/public.

If you are writing to or reading from a file at n8n's static cache directory via a node, e.g. Read/Write Files from Disk, please update your node to use a different path.
