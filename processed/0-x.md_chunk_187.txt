### Node enhancements

Webhook node: when test the node by selecting **Listen For Test Event** then dispatching a call to the webhook, n8n now only runs the Webhook node. Previously, n8n ran the entire workflow. You can still test the full workflow by selecting **Test Workflow**, then dispatching a test call.
