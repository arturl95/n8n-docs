* **Name**: The name of the vector store.
* **Description**: Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often.
* **Memory Key**: Enter the key to use to store the vector memory in the workflow data. n8n prefixes the key with the workflow ID to avoid collisions.
* **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.
