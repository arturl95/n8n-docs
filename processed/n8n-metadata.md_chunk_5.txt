| `$prevNode.outputIndex` | The index of the output connector that the current input came from. Use this when the previous node had multiple outputs (such as an If or Switch node).  When using the Merge node, note that `$prevNode` always uses the first input connector. | :white_check_mark: |
	| `$prevNode.runIndex` | The run of the previous node that generated the current input. When using the Merge node, note that `$prevNode` always uses the first input connector. | :white_check_mark: |
